🏠 House Maintenance Management System

📌 Project Overview The House Maintenance Management System is designed to help homeowners efficiently manage and track all maintenance activities such as structural repairs, electrical work, plumbing, cleaning, and safety checks. This system automates scheduling, reminders, and record-keeping to ensure regular maintenance, reducing unexpected failures and costly repairs.

🎯 Problem Statement Maintaining a house involves multiple tasks such as structural repairs, electrical and plumbing maintenance, cleaning, and safety checks. In many households, these activities are performed irregularly or only when problems occur. This reactive approach leads to:

Water leakage
Electrical faults
Poor hygiene
Increased repair costs
Safety risks
⚠️ Limitations → Mostly manual tracking → No automation or smart alerts → Not designed for individual households → No integration of all maintenance tasks in one place → Difficult for beginners to use

💡 Proposed Solution

The proposed system provides an automated workflow:

👉 Task → Schedule → Reminder → Maintenance → Record Update

✅ Key Benefits → Automatic scheduling of maintenance tasks → Smart reminders and alerts → Centralized tracking system → Easy-to-use interface → Maintenance history storage → Improved safety and cost reduction

🔄 Workflow User adds maintenance task (e.g., plumbing check, electrical inspection) System schedules the task (daily / weekly / monthly) Reminder is sent before due date

After completion: → Task status is updated → Record is saved in database → Dashboard displays: → Pending tasks → Completed tasks → Upcoming maintenance → Alerts for urgent issues

🚀 Final Stack Summary

Frontend - React.js Backend - Node.js + Express Database - MongoDB (Mongoose) Authentication - JWT (JSON Web Token)
